<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I had been expirimenting with Unity3d and C# for about a year and thought it was time to produce my first complete game.
I took some inspiration from an old flash game I used to play as a kid and made a mobile game using the same concept and expanding it
making unique twists to it. 

The goal of the game is to move a brick from the start position to the end tile (the blue tile) with an upright position. The game might
seem simple, but it is actually quite complex and requires some level of strategy and planning to reach the end tile. 

Each of the 84 levels guide the players to understand the game's mechanics and guides them to use those mechanics in upcomming levels.

- Note: I made this project in 2018 and recently updated it a little to make it presentable.

### Built With
- Unity3d and C#. 
  - I learned Unity3d and C# by myself by making multiple games with my free time.
- The levels were designed using a 20x20 pixel bitmap of different colors representing different tiles types. A class is then responsible to convert
the bitmap image to a playable level.
